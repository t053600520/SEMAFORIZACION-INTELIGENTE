	abstract = {In the last decade, pressure-based schemes such as Back Pressure and Max Weight algorithms have been widely researched and applied for traffic signal control due to their simplicity and proven throughput maximization. In such algorithms, the next chosen signal phase at an intersection in a road network is the one with the highest measured weight, representing the pressure of traffic movements at the intersection, determined based on a single characteristic of the traffic flow or vehicles’ state at that intersection. This paper develops a new optimal Max Weight control mechanism to enhance the network throughput and reduce vehicle delays in a network using a concept of platooning enabled by Connected Vehicles (CVs). To this end, we propose a new proven optimal Max Weight control scheme where the weight consists of several features including the platoon delay, as well as the speed and position of vehicles within the platoon. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a platoon pressure-based concept considering multiple configurable attributes in formulating the pressure. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous stability proof that ensures the throughput optimality of the proposed control scheme. In addition, we also develop a machine learning procedure in this paper to optimize the weighting parameter of each attribute contributing to the total pressure enabling its seamless deployment in practice. A number of simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the learning procedure and show that our Max Weight platoon pressure-based scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art and well-known existing pressure-based algorithms.},

	abstract = {Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) proves its effectiveness in alleviating traffic congestion, especially in urban areas. The implementation of Transit Signal Priority (TSP) for BRT has shown a significant reduction in delays. However, in densely populated urban areas, this priority can inadvertently cause additional delays for other modes of transportation. In this paper, we propose a control strategy for Regionally Coordinating Bus Priority Signals Control (RCBPSC) at urban intersections. The aim is not only to reduce bus delays but also to consider minimizing delays for pedestrians and other vehicles. To achieve this, we modeled two consecutive intersections along the Amman BRT. Essentially, we evaluated three different control scenarios in addition to the current base scenario. These scenarios include adaptive traffic signal control, RCBPSC with no signal timing optimization, and RCBPSC with signal optimization. Simulation results indicate that the adaptive traffic signal timing has the worst operational performance in terms of average delay and Level of Service (LOS) compared to the base scenario. Additionally, the results show that BRT delays significantly decrease at both intersections when we implement RCBPSC scenarios. When implementing RCBPSC with optimization scenarios, the results show an average reduction of more than 60% in intersection delay, a decrease in emissions of more than 50%, and an improved LOS for system users compared to the base scenario. The findings of this work can help agencies improve the current operational condition of BRT when implementing RCBPSC.},

	abstract = {One of the focal points in the field of intelligent transportation is the intelligent control of traffic signals (TS), aimed at enhancing the efficiency of urban road networks through specific algorithms. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have become mainstream, yet they suffer from inefficient training sample selection, leading to slow convergence. Additionally, enhancing model robustness is crucial for adapting to diverse traffic conditions. Hence, this paper proposes an enhanced method for traffic signal control (TSC) based on DRL. This approach utilizes dueling network and double q-learning to alleviate the overestimation issue of DRL. Additionally, it introduces a priority sampling mechanism to enhance the utilization efficiency of samples in memory. Moreover, noise parameters are integrated into the neural network model during training to bolster its robustness. By representing high-dimensional real-time traffic information as matrices, and employing a phase-cycled action space to guide the decision-making of intelligent agents. Additionally, utilizing a reward function that closely mirrors real-world scenarios to guide model training. Experimental results demonstrate faster convergence and optimal performance in metrics such as queue length and waiting time. Testing experiments further validate the method's robustness across different traffic flow scenarios.},

	abstract = {Since their appearance at the end of the 19th century, traffic lights have been the primary mode of granting access to road intersections. Today, this centuries-old technology is challenged by advances in intelligent transportation, which are opening the way to new solutions built upon slot-based systems similar to those commonly used in aerial traffic: what we call Slot-based Intersections (SIs). Despite simulation-based evidence of the potential benefits of SIs, a comprehensive, analytical framework to compare their relative performance with traffic lights is still lacking. Here, we develop such a framework. We approach the problem in a novel way, by generalizing classical queuing theory. Having defined safety conditions, we characterize capacity and delay of SIs. In the 2-road crossing configuration, we provide a capacity-optimal SI management system. For arbitrary intersection configurations, near-optimal solutions are developed. Results theoretically show that transitioning from a traffic light system to SI has the potential of doubling capacity and significantly reducing delays. This suggests a reduction of non-linear dynamics induced by intersection bottlenecks, with positive impact on the road network. Such findings can provide transportation engineers and planners with crucial insights as they prepare to manage the transition towards a more intelligent transportation infrastructure in cities.},
